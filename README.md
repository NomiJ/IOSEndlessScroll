# IOSEndlessScroll
This is a proof concept algorithm will explain how to create an endless or infinite scrollview using 3 view circulation logic.

The current commit show following

1 - Creation of endless scroll using 3 views in rotation
2 - Drawing a random line everytime the view appears on screen
3 - Using simple Rotation transformation, we can change the direction of scroll. This actually help us to keep our coordinates in +ve. So instead of drawing upside down, we will draw normally and just rotate the final view.
